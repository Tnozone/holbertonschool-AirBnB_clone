					This is a lovely 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom appartment that accomodate 2 people comfortably. It is located 3 blocks away from downtown Orlando and 20 mins away from the theme parks. Transportation is a breeze as it is just one block away from the bus stop and near the main roads.

					This place is a cozy, affordable bungalow. It is located on the outskirts of Tampa and it can accomodate 4 people nicely. It is close to main roads however public transportation is a bit hard to come by. However, we are confident that the nature surrounded environment will captivate you!

							<h3>From Max the 15th January 2017</h3>
							<p>Fantastic Place. It was clean, Adrienne was great and everything went super smooth. Location is also great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you might have to uber into the city from location. Overall, would recommend the place anytime.</p>
